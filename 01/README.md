Lecture 01 - Intro to C++
=========================

## Source Code

This directory contains code similar to that which I (hope to) develop "live" in class, as well as any supplemental material.

The ``code_from_slides`` subdirectory will contain compilable code that you may see in the slides. Even if we don't cover the slides in class, I'll provide them for your review. You should be able to find the filename of code somewhere near it on the slide.

* Directories that I give you containing code will always include a Makefile. Just type ``make`` to build all of the code, or at least to obtain further instructions.

The ``java`` subdirectory contains code for the Java addendum. You may (and should!) completely ignore it unless you're attempting that (very optional) additional learning path.

## Searching for Keywords

To search for source files containing a specific word such as "override", try e.g., ``grep override *``. If you're searching for a phrase containing spaces such as "multiple inheritance", put them in double quotes, e.g., ``grep "multiple inheritance" *``.

You can also search through the slides and other PDF documents, too, if you put them in a common directory under Linux. To find "multiple inheritance" in a directory containing files with a .pdf extension, try ``pdfgrep "multiple inheritance" *.pdf``. Note that Linux cares about file name capitalization, so if you use the more Windows-like .PDF extension, use ``pdfgrep "multiple inheritance" *.PDF`` instead!
